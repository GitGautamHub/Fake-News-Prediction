## Fake News Prediction

Welcome to the Fake News Prediction project repository! This project uses machine learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake based on content analysis. The dataset includes textual features, and models are trained using Python with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn.

### Key Features

- **Dataset:** Contains textual features from news articles for training and evaluation.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of text data using NLTK for stopword removal and stemming.
  
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Logistic Regression from scikit-learn for classification tasks.
  
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy score measure model performance.

### Libraries Used

- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text processing tasks including stopwords removal and stemming.
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning models, feature extraction, and evaluation metrics.

### Project Structure

- **`data/`:** Directory for datasets used in training and evaluation.
  
- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks (`Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb`) for step-by-step implementation of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **`src/`:** Python scripts (`data_preprocessing.py`, `model_training.py`) for modularized code implementation.
